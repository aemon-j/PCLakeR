If the model does not compile, you can check via the cmd box if the command file "compile_model_cpp.cmd" works.

During the compilation you might see a lot of text running by, which is hard to read, and part of it gets lost - although it might be of interest.
If you want to get the full output from the compilation, put both the messages and the errors into additional text files by typing in the command line:
compile_model_cpp.cmd >info.txt 2>error.txt
